The Cu Chi Tunnels are an immense network of interconnected tunnels near Saigon that are part of a much larger network lying below  much of the country. A guided visit to these tunnels provides a better understanding of their history, the hardship of life underground and the resilience of the Vietnamese during combat. The tunnels were built and used initially by the Viet Cong guerrillas as hiding spots to protect them from the French air and ground sweeps. They later served as communication routes, storage facilities, hospitals and living quarters for the guerrilla fighters throughout the Vietnam-American war. You're invited to enter a section of the tunnels to witness the secrets of the tunnels firsthand. Your guide will also show you various mantraps employed from this period, the remains of an American tank and numerous B52 bomb craters. There is also the opportunity to fire an M60, M16 or AK47 rifle at the range next to the tunnel complex (at own cost). <strong>Overnight stay at hotel in Ho Chi Minh City.</strong> (The hotel room will be available at 2:00pm, and in case that you would like to secure an early-check-in, an additional charge will be applied)</p></td>
