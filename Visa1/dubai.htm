                            <p> Dubai is the second-largest of the seven city-states in the   United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi is the largest, with proven oil   reserves of 92 billion barrels. Since Dubai only has oil reserves of 4   billion barrels, it focused on developing itself as a major world   financial center and Tourism destination.<br />
                                <br />
                              Until the recession, all went well. In 2004, the Dubai government began   building theBurj Dubai, now known as the Burj al Arab. It is the world's   tallest building. It also backedDubai World famous for its real estate   developments: man-made islands built to look like the world map and a   palm tree. On March 23, 2011, Dubai World negotiated restructuring on   $25 billion in debt with its 80 creditors. Dubai World stunned the world   on November 25, 2009, when it asked its creditors to delay interest   payments on $60 billion in debt.<br />
                              <br />
                              Most of Dubai's business investments is in hard-to-sell real estate. The   global recession made these assets difficult to lease, thus putting   Dubai World in a cash-flow crunch. Dubai's government debts ran up to   $120 billion.<br />
                              <br />
                              Creditors were worried that Dubai would go bankrupt, joining Iceland.   The news came at the time of great concern about many European Union   countries, especially Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.</p></td>

                            <p> The history of Dubai points at a story of   rolling sand dunes lapping the foothills on the Eastern side of Mount   Hajar. Dubai owes its present identity to the wise vision of the late   Sheikh Zayed and Sheikh Maktoum. Today Dubai is an Economic powerhouse   and truly a world class city but the history of Dubai points at a   completely different picture. It was just a decade or two back that   Dubai was inhabited by Bedouins and Nomads who traveled all over the   place with their flocks and herds. The settlements, as a history of   Dubai points out, were mainly inhabited by the fishermen community who   lived along the coast of the Arabian Gulf and earned their living by   fishing, pearling, herding sheep and goats. </p>
                          <p>The importance of this small coastal settlement   increased with it becoming a trading Port.Under the British   Protectorate the volume of trade expanded and the merchant appeal of   Dubai grew.History of Dubai now saw a major influx of foreign population   into the area and by the year 1930s Persians, Indians, Baluchis,   communities of Bahrain all flocked into Dubai.</p>
                          <p>1971 was a major turning point in the   history of Dubai when the British withdrew and Dubai joined Abu Dhabi,   Sharjah, Aiman, Umm Al Quwain, Fajairah which was later named as the   Federation Of the United Emirates. Oil was already discovered in the   year 1966 and the successful shipment of Oil opened a new chapter in the   history of Dubai. The entire infrastructure of the city was now new.   Detached from the history of Dubai, modern Dubai is now an economic hub.</p></td>

                            <p> Dubai culture today is very different from what it used to be a decade   or two ago. The narrow widening creek divides the city into two parts,   the Southern part called Bur Dubai has a traditional culture in Dubai   and the Northern area, Deira has a busy and bustling culture. The Al   Shindagha tunnel which runs under the creek connects the two halves of   the city. </p>
                          <p>The Dubai cultureis a cosmopolitan one. With the influx of great   number of foreign population which includes, Persians, Indians, Baluchis   etc ,the culture in Dubai has become a global one. With Islam as its   official religion , Culture in Dubai is essentially a Muslim one but the   presence of Hindus, Christians, Sikhs etc cannot be ignored and their   presence has left an undeniable mark on the Culture in Dubai.</p>
                          <p>Like religion, language Culture in Dubaiis also diverse and   although Arabic is declared to be the official language of Dubai, other   languages of the world co-exist with it. The schools are also not biased   regarding language and many of them teach foreign languages to the   children.</p>
                          <p>Dubai culture is essentially very colorful and vibrant. The Dubai   shopping festival and the Dubai International Film Festival are an   integral part of the culture in Dubai.</p></td>

                            <p> Located on the Persian Gulf, between Sharjah and Abu Dhabi,   Dubai is one of the seven emirates that comprise the United Arab   Emirates (UAE). Geography of Dubai is as interesting as the emirate   itself is. </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Area of Dubai</p>
                          <p> Dubai has an area of about 3,885 sq km, making it the second   largest emirate after Abu Dhabi. One of the most interesting   geographical features of Dubai is the Dubai Creek, a natural inlet in   Persian Gulf, dividing the city into two parts - the Deira to its north   and Bur Dubai to its south.</p>
                          <p>The unique location and geography of Dubai allows it to connect   to all neighboring Gulf States, as well as South Asia and East Africa   by sea or land.</p>
                          <p>The UAE has 700 km long coastline of which 100 km are on the   Gulf of Oman, which connects the country to the Arabian Sea. Dubai is   also a major stopover for flights from Asia to Europe and vice versa.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Desert Landscape</p>
                          <p> Dubai has a primarily desert landscape with extensive sand   dunes, oases and wadis (dry river bed). There are also some spectacular   offshore islands, coral reefs and sabhka, or salt marshes. That's not   all about Dubai geography. Visitors will be surprised to see a range of   mountains lying close to the Gulf of Oman.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Currency</p>
                          <p> The Currency in Dubai is the UAE Dirham (Dh), or the United Arab Emirate   Dirham (AED), as it's termed in the international market. One Dirham is   equal to 100 Fils. Dubai currency notes are available in denominations   of 5,10,20,50,100,200,500 and 1000 Dirhams.</p></td>

                          <p>An attractive way to view the Creek and the dhows is from an abra,   one of the small water taxis which criss-cross the Creek from the souks   of Deira to those on the Bur Dubai side.</p>
                          <p>Boatmen will also take visitors on a fascinating hour-long trip   from the abra embarkation points to the mouth of the Creek and inland   to the Maktoum Bridge, passing on the way many of the city&rsquo;s historic   and modern landmarks.</p>
                          <p>Redevelopment work has transformed parts of the Creek&rsquo;s banks.   On the Deira side, a broad and well-lit, paved promenade extends from   the Corniche, which faces on the Arabian Gulf, all the way to the   attractive purpose-built dhow terminal constructed beside Maktoum Bridge</p>
                          <p>On the Bur Dubai side between Maktoum and Garhoud bridges,   Creekside Park provides pleasant paved walks and extensive landscaped   public gardens.</p>
                          <p>At the inland end of the Creek is a large, shallow lagoon, now a   wildlife sanctuary which has become a haven for migrating shore birds.   Some 27,000 birds have been counted here at one time during the autumn   migration. The most spectacular are the many Greater Flamingos which   have made the Creek their permanent home.</p>
                          <p>Archaeological Sites You can visit the excavation sites at Al   Ghusais, Al Sufooh and Jumeirah where you will find arte facts from the   seventh to 15th centuries.</p>
                          <p>Bastakiya The old Bastakiya district with its narrow lanes and   tall wind-towers gives a tantalizing glimpse of old Dubai. Immediately   to the east of Al Fahidi Fort is the largest concentration of   traditional courtyard houses with wind towers. In the past, the city was   famous for a mass of wind towers which lined the Creek on either side.   These were not merely decorative; they were the only means of cooling   houses in the days before electricity.</p>
                          <p>Burj Nahar One of three watchtowers guarding the old city, the   restored Burj Nahar in its picturesque gardens in Deira is popular with   photographers</p>

                          <p> Indego is the creation of chef Vineet Bhatia and is an establishment   laden with style, class and excellent cuisine. The carefully chosen   items in the interior of the restaurant simply exude elegance and also   hint at the fact that the menu prices are going to be a bit higher than   some other Indian restaurants around Dubai. With that said, all you have   to do is taste the tandoori salmon or other popular Indian fare and   know that Indego is here to stay.<br />
