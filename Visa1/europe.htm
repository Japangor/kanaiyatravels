                            <p> Homo georgicus,   which lived roughly 1.8 million years ago in Georgia, is the earliest   hominid to have been discovered in Europe. Other hominid remains, dating   back roughly 1 million years, have been discovered in Atapuerca, Spain.   Neanderthal man(named for the Neandertal valley in Germany) appeared in   Europe 150,000 years ago and disappeared from the fossil record about   28,000 BC, with this extinction probably due to climate change, and   their final refuge being present-day Portugal. The Neanderthals were   supplanted by modern humans (Cro-Magnons), who appeared in Europe around   43 to 40 thousand years ago.The European Neolithic period&mdash;marked by the   cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of   settlements and the widespread use of pottery&mdash;began around 7000 BC in   Greece and the Balkans, probably influenced by earlier farming practices   in Anatolia and the Near East. <br />
                                <br />
                              It spread from South Eastern Europe along the valleys of the   Danube and the Rhine (Linear Pottery culture) and along the   Mediterranean coast (Cardial culture). Between 4500 and 3000 BC, these   central European neolithic cultures developed further to the west and   the north, transmitting newly acquired skills in producing copper   artefacts. In Western Europe the Neolithic period was characterized not   by large agricultural settlements but by field monuments, such as   causewayed enclosurees, burial mounds andmegalithic tombs. The Corded   Ware cultural horizon flourished at the transition from the Neolithic to   the Chalcolithic. During this period giant megalithic monuments, such   as the Megalithic Temples of Malta and Stonehenge, were constructed   throughout Western and Southern Europe. The European Bronze Age began in   the late 3rd millennium BC with the Beaker culture.The European Iron   Age began around 800 BC, with the Hallstatt culture. Iron Age   colonisation by the Phoenicians gave rise to early Mediterranean cities.   Early Iron Age Italy and Greece from around the 8th century BC   gradually gave rise to historical Classical antiquity.<br />

                            <p> A Tourist planning for a Switzerland   Tour is always inquisitive about the Tourist places to be visited   during that Switzerland Tour. Fortunately in the whole of Western   Europe, which is thronged by the travellers during the vacations,   Switzerland is the most popular Tourist country. The most popular   Tourist places within Switzerland are Geneva, Zurich, Lucerne, Zermatt,   Interlaken etc. Apart from these, there are other ones too, though less   popular yet picturesque. Switzerland Tourism Department is also active   in the area of promoting travel and Tourism in the country. </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Interlaken</p>
                          <p> Interlaken is a charming little resort village tucked away in   the Alps. This Swiss city is a paradise for mountaineers, skiers, and   adventure sports lovers. Those who do not wish to be quite so   exploratory on their vacation need not despair, Interlaken's splendid   natural beauty, the icy majesty of the Alps, the little red trains   chugging through green hillsides- all make Interlaken a nature lover's   paradise. You can spend hours amidst the majestic Eiger and Monch, lost   in contemplation; or if you are a poet, penning down some tribute to the   beauty of Interlaken!<br />
                                <br />
                            The Jungfrau is by far the most popular Tourist attraction in   Interlaken, Switzerland. Once you have reached the summit by cable car,   you will enter a winter wonderland that reminds you of Santa Claus'   workshop! The Ice Palace and the Sphinx Observation Hall are also   intriguingly beautiful. The Alpine Garden in Shynige Platte is great a   visit for botany enthusiasts. The Shynige Platt also features a   permanent Teddy Bear Exhibition that is sure to be a hit with children. </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Lucerne</p>
                          <p> Lucerne is the most populous city in Central Switzerland, and a   nexus of transportation, telecommunications, and government of this   region. The city's metropolitan area consists of 17 cities and towns   located in three different cantons with an overall population of about   250,000 people. It has a number of bridges. The Bridge with its Tower is   the city's most famous landmark.The twin needle towers of the Church of   St. Leodegar, which was named after the city's patron saint, sit on a   small hill just above the lake front.Contributing to Lucerne's cityscape   alongside the world-famous Chapel Bridge and Water Tower are the Musegg   Wall, the Jesuit Church, the Mill Bridge, the Lion Monument, the KKL   culture and convention centre, and a host of other sites of interest.   Lucerne is best discovered on foot &ndash; so why not take one of our many   guided Tours? </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Jungfraujoch - Top of Europe</p>
                          <p> The Jungfraujoch is a col or saddle between the Monch and the Jungfrau   in the Bernese Alps on the boundary between the cantons of Bern and   Valais, inside the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area.Strictly, the   Jungfraujoch is the lowest point on the mountain ridge between Monch and   Jungfrau, at 3,471 meters (11,388 ft). It is just above this location   that the mountain station of Jungfraubahn is located, Jungfraujoch   railway station, which at an elevation of 3,454 meters (11,332 ft) is   the highest railway station in Europe. The Jungfraujoch is often called   the &quot;Top of Europe&quot; in Tourist literature.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Mt. Titlis - A Landscape Close To Heaven</p>
                          <p> The Titlis (3,238 m) is a mountain in the Urner Alps of   Switzerland. It is located on the border between the cantons of Obwalden   and Berne in  Switzerland, overlooking Engelberg (Obwalden) and is   famous as the site of the world's first revolving cable car. The cable   car system connects Engelberg to the summit of Klein Titlis through the   three stages of Gerschnialp (1,262 m), Trubsee (1,796 m) and Stand(2,428   m).</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Lugano</p>
                          <p> Lugano is located on the Italian border with Switzerland. So   it is no surprise that the region has traces of Italian influence in its   culture. The city of parks, a lake and beautiful hills is a Tourist   paradise. Switzerland Hub takes you on a Tour of Lugano, as you enjoy   the many wonderful sights and sounds of the cities of Switzerland The   lush parks of Lugano are a sight for sore eyes. The Belvedere Garden on   the shore of the Lake Geneva has wonderful walkways that allow you to   stroll through the park, admiring the beauty of the flowers and plants.   The Ciani Parkoffers you a splendid view of the Lake Ceresio, and has   some grand old trees, gnarled and knotted with age.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Geneva</p>
                          <p> Geneva is the one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the   world. The city has over 40 museums, and many pubs, cafes, and   nightclubs. The Art and History Museum and the Natural History Museum   are a must visit for all those who wish to know about the history and   culture of Geneva. The Red Cross Museum offers visitors a glimpse into   the various humanitarian crises that have overshadowed the world from   time to time and the stellar role played by the organization in   alleviating the suffering of people. Another Geneva Tourist attraction   is the Jet d'Eau, the 140-meter high fountain in Lake Geneva that is   visible from most parts of the city.The Jet d'Eau is a large fountain in   Geneva and is one of the city's most famous landmarks. Five hundred   litres (132 gallons) of water per second are jetted to an altitude of   140 metres (459 feet) by two 500 kW pumps, consuming over one megawatt   of electricity. Geneva is also famous for its breathtaking beauty.   Situated on the shores of the Lake Geneva, Geneva is a Tourist paradise   for thousands of people from around the world. The Flower Clock is a   timekeeper made of real flowers, located inside a lush landscaped   garden.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Zurich</p>
                          <p> The Zurich Great Minster, dating back to the 12th century, has   none of the light whimsicality associated with the monuments of   Switzerland. The dark, brooding aspect of the monument is probably a   testimony of its times, since the period was one of the more turbulent   ones in the history of Switzerland. The Swiss National Museum is another   Zurich Tourist attraction. Here, you will get to know more about the   history and culture of Zurich. The museum is situated just behind the   Main Station, making it easily accessible by Metro Train. When you are   near any lake in Switzerland, your experience remains incomplete without   a lake cruise in Switzerland. The Lake Zurich, placid and serene, is a   paradise for those who love boat cruises. As you cruise from Burkliplatz   to Bahnhofstrasse, you will be able to take in some lovely scenery and   understand why Switzerland is so popular as a Tourist destination. </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Bern</p>
                          <p> The capital of Switzerland, Bern, is a charming blend of the modern   and traditional. The latest models in cars whiz past the UNESCO   recognized Heritage Site of the city, as the tall church spires and 18th   century mansions jostle for space with spanking new exhibition centers,   Grand Prix racetracks and pubs And when it comes to Museums and   Theaters, Bern relegates competitors to the background.

                          <p> Located in an unexpected and fairly barren area on the edge of   north-west London this stunning Hindu temple is an amazing spiritual and   architectural gem, well worth the trip out to the suburbs - in fact,   the bleak location makes the beauty and symbolism of the temple all the   most spectacular. The first traditional Hindu Mandir in Europe, every   one of the 26,300 individually carved pieces that make up Shri   Swaminarayan Mandir in its entirety were carved in India and shipped   over to London. All of these pieces were then fitted together in just   three years, between 1992 and 1995. Inside and outside this place, also   known as the Neasden Temple, is absolutely stunning.</p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">The London Eye</p>

Since   its opening, the Eye has become a major landmark and Tourist attraction   and one of the iconic sights of London.

St Pauls is one of the places where national events   of great importance take place.

The Whispering   Gallery which runs around the interior of the Dome and is 259 steps up   from ground-level fascinates both children and adults because a whisper   made against its walls can be heard on the opposite side.</p>

                          <p class="main-text-002">Boat Tour of The Seine River</p>
                          <p> Seeing some of Paris' most beautiful sites glide past as you drift   down the Seine river is an unforgettable and essential experience.   Companies such as Bateaux Parisiens offer 1-hour Tours of the Seine   year-round for about 10 Euros. You can hop on near Notre Dame or the   Eiffel Tower. Go at night to enjoy the shimmering play of light on the   water, and dress warmly- the wind from off the Seine can be chilly. You   can also take Tours of some of Paris' canals and waterways, which will   allow you to see a semi-hidden side of the city of light. </p>
                          <p class="main-text-002">Eiffel Tower</p>
                          <p> More than any other landmark, the Eiffel Tower has come to   represent an elegant and contemporary Paris. The iron tower, which was   built for the 1889 World Exposition by Gustave Eiffel, was wildly   unpopular with Parisians when it was unveiled, and was nearly torn down.   It has since attracted over 220 million visitors, and it would be hard   to imagine Paris now without it. The tower crowns the Paris night sky   with its festive light, and glitters up a storm every hour. Cliche?   Maybe. But essential.</p></td>
