                            <p> The name &lsquo;Bhutan&rsquo; appears to derive from the Sanskrit   &lsquo;Bhotant&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;the end of Tibet&rsquo; or from &lsquo;Bhu-uttan&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;high   land&rsquo;. Though known as Bhutan to the outside world, the Bhutanese   themselves refer to their country as Druk Yul or the Land of the Thunder   Dragon. &lsquo;Druk&rsquo; meaning &lsquo;Dragon&rsquo; and extending from the predominant   Drukpa school of Tibetan Buddhism. </p>
                          <p>The documented history of the Kingdom begins with 747 A.D.   with Guru Padsambhava also known as Guru Rinpoche who made his legendary   trip from Tibet across the mountains flying on a tigress&rsquo;s back. He   arrived in Paro valley at Taktsang Lhakhang also known as Tiger&rsquo;s Nest.   Guru Rinpoche is not only recognized as the founder of the Nyingmapa   religious school but also considered to be second Buddha. In the ensuing   centuries, many great masters preached the faith resulting in full   bloom of Buddhism by the middle ages. Although sectarian at first, the   country was eventually unified under Drukpa Kagyupa sect of Mahayana   Buddhism by saint/administrator Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th   century. Ngawang Namgyal codified a comprehensive system of laws and   built a chain of Dzongs which guarded each valley during unsettled times   and now serving as the religious and administrative centre of the   region.</p>
                          <p>During the next two centuries civil wars intermittently   broke out and the regional Governors became increasingly more powerful.   At the end of 19th century, Trongsa Governor overcame all his rivals and   soon afterwards recognized as the overall leader of Bhutan. The   Governor of Trongsa, Sir Ugyen Wangchuck, was elected as the first King   of Bhutan in 1907 by an assembly of representatives of the monastic   community, civil servants and people. The country has now the system of   democratic monarchy. The monarchy has thrived ever since and the present   King, His Majesty Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the first King&rsquo;s great   grandson, commands the overwhelming support of his people. After   assuming the throne in 1974, the present king continued his father&rsquo;s   policy of pragmatic development by actively pursuing industrial   progress, country wide education and medical care and at the same time   ensuring country&rsquo;s cultural and natural heritage intact.</p>

                          <p> Thimphu lies in a   wooded valley, sprawling up a hillside on the West Bank of the Thimphu   Chhu [Chhu means River]. Thimphu is unlike any other world capital.   Small and secluded the city is quiet and there are never the traffic   jams familiar in other Asian Capitals. It is often said that Thimphu is   the only world capital without traffic lights. Thimphu's main shopping   street is a delight not so much for what you can buy there, but for the   picturesqueness of the architecture and national costume. Beautiful   weaves in wool, silk and cotton, basketwork, silver jewelry, thangkas   and other traditional crafts of the Kingdom are available in various   Handicraft Emporiums.<br />

                          <p> Rinchen build a temple there   which can still be seen today opposite to the great Dzong. Shabdrung   Nawang Namgyel a key figure in the History of Bhutan built the Punakha   Dzong and his body is preserved in one of the Dzongs temples, Machen   Lhakhang. The Dzong was damaged six times by fire, once by floods and   once by earthquake. The coronation of Ugyen Wangchuk, the first king of   Bhutan, took place at Punakha Dzong on 17th December 1907. </p>

                            <br />
                            Meaning &quot;the palace where the four directions are gathered under the   power of the Shabdrung&rdquo;. However the popular story has it that the   Shabdrung arrived at the river and happened to see a boy building a sand   castle. He asked for the boy's name, which was Wangdue, and thereupon   decided to name the Dzong Wangdue Phodrang or 'Wangdue's Palace.'   Wangdue Phodrang Dzong is perched on a spur at the confluence of 02   rivers. The position of the Dzong is remarkable as it completely covers   the spur and commands an impressive view over both the north-south and   east-west roads. The main road climbs the length of the spur and on the   left, across the river, comes the first glimpse of the picturesque   village of Rinchengang whose inhabitants are celebrated stonemasons.   Phuntsoling </p>
                          <p>This small modern town in the south is   the gateway of Bhutan for overland travelers. Like all other border   towns, it is also a prelude. Phuntsholing is also a fascinating mixture   of Bhutanese and Indian, a lively center for the mingling people,   languages, customs and goods. On top of a low hill at nearby Kharbandi, a   small Gompa situated in a garden of tropical plants and flowers   overlooks the town and surrounding plains.</p>
                          <p>The Amo Chu, commonly known as the Torsa   river flows alongside this town and it is favorite spot for fisherman   and the picnickers. From Phuntsholing, the road winds north over the   southern foothills, through lush forested valleys and around the rugged   north-south ridges of the inner Himalayas to the central valleys of   Thimphu and Paro. It is a scenic journey; forests festooned with orchids   cover the mountains on the other side and exciting hairpin curves greet   travelers with colorful sculptures of Tashi Tagye (The eight auspicious   signs of Buddhism).</p>
                          <p class="main-text-01">Trongsa</p>
                          <p> Trongsa means 'The New Village' and   the founding of Trongsa first dates from the 16th century which is   indeed relatively recent for Bhutan. It was the Drukpa lama, Ngagi   Wangchuk (1517-54), the great grandfather of Shabdrung Nawang Namgyel,   who founded the first temple at Trongsa in 1543. The landscape around   Trongsa is spectacular, and for miles on the end the Dzong seems to   tease you so that you wonder if you will ever reach Trongsa. The view   extends for many kilometers and in the former times, nothing could   escape the vigilance of its watchmen. <br />

                          <p> The Bumthang region encompasses four   major valleys: Choskhor, Tang, Ura and Chhume. The Dzongs and the most   important temples are in the large Choskhor valley, commonly referred to   as Bumthang valley.            There are two versions of the origin of   the name Bumthang. The valley is supposed to be shaped like a Gompa, a   vessel that contains holy water, and Thang meaning flat place. The   religious connotation of the name aptly applies to the sacred character   of the region. It would be difficult to find so many important temples   and monasteries in such a small area anywhere else in Bhutan. <br />

                              Mongar</span></p>
                          <p> The Mongar district is the northern portion   of the ancient region of Kheng. Mongar is the district headquarters and   hardly more than a stopping place surrounded by fields of maize. It is   also the first town built in a mountain side instead of in a valley, a   characteristic of eastern Bhutan where the valleys are usually little   more than riverbeds and mountain slopes which rise abruptly from the   rivers, flatten out as they approach their summits. One would never   imagine that the upper parts of the mountains are so densely populated. <br />
                                <br />
                            Shongar Dzong, Mongar's original Dzong, is in ruins   and the new dzong in Mongar town is not as architecturally spectacular   as others in the region. Dramtse Goemba, in the eastern part of the   district, is an important Nyingmapa Monastery, but it is difficult to   get there.<br />

                          <p> Lhuentse is an isolated district although   there are many sizeable villages in the hill throughout the region. It   is very rural and there are fewer than five vehicles, including an   ambulance, and not a single petrol station, in the whole district.<br />
                                <br />
                            Formerly known as Kurtoe, the region is the ancestral home of Bhutan's   Royal Family. Though geographically in the east, it was culturally   identified with central Bhutan, and the route over the Rodung-la was a   major trade route until the road to Mongar was completed. To see and   appreciate Lhuentse properly, with its many small villages and ancient   temples, you should really explore on foot. <br />

                          <p>Trashigang is one of the most densely populated   districts in Bhutan. After Thimphu, Trashigang is the biggest urban   center in mountainous Bhutan. It is the heart of eastern Bhutan and was   once the center of important trade with Tibet. There are several gompas   and villages that make a visit worthwhile, but it is a remote region and   requires a lot of driving to reach. <br />

                          <p> The small frontier town is situated at the   precise point where the mountains meet the plains. There is almost   nothing of interest to the traveler in south-eastern Bhutan. It is the   headquarters of a district boasting a brand new Dzong, although it is   basically a town of small shopkeepers who serve all of eastern Bhutan as   far as Mongar and Lhuntshi. The tropical heat gives a languid air which   is accentuated by a lack of busy traffic.</p></td>
