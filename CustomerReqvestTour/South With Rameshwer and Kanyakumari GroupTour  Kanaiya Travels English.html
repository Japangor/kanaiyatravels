It is nothing but a strip of land about one km wide and 18 km long on the eastern end of Rameswaram island which divides the waters of the Indian Ocean on one side and on the other the waters of the Bay of Bengal. The two seas otherwise known as Ratnakaran and Mahodadhi with their confluence is shaped like a bow while the strip of land resemble an arrow poised for release. Devout Hindus consider the Adi Sethu or the arrowhead, a sacred place to perform religious rites. It is also place worth visiting for its scenic beauty and bird life.  Over night Rameshwar.</td>
