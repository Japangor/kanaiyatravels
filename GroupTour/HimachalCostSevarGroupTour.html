             <li>Bogus travel agents cheat tourists by opening their rental office during the holidays and offering seductive and low price advertisements in the news paper, as well as taking advantage of their naivety and ignorance</li>
             <li>Beware of tour operators who cheat by stealing things like hotel photos - photos of other groups and videos through the internet.</li>
             <li>Typically fake travel agents rent an office and home to avoid legal action. Therefore, before booking the tour, get the telephone number of the tour operator as well as the members of the house and the house and keep the photo of the tour operator in your mobile.</li>
             <li>Like you, we also read the travel advertisement of cheap price in the newspaper but we are not afraid of it or we are not even competing. Compare the total cost of hotel + vehicle + food and the price of your trip. Estimate the cost of salary + light bill + telephone bill + advertising cost in news paper + profit + income tax + other tax etc. If the sum of these costs exceeds the cost of the trip you paid, then understand that you are being cheated.</li>
             <li>Nowadays, even when our child goes to school for a day's picnic, it usually costs Rs 1000 to Rs 1500 per child for 1 day - which includes getting on the bus - going - 1 time Tea, Breakfast - Lunch and light refreshments in the evening. Then how can you travel 8 to 9 days for popular tourist destinations like Kashmir - Ladakh - Sikkim - Kerala - Himachal - South - Uttarakhand for 12000 to 13000 rupees. If any fake tour operators offer cheap tours, then think that they are going to cheat</li>
             <li>When you travel as a traveler, you should know about how many years the tour operator has experience in the travel business, the background of the tour operator, how the hotel provides, how the food is provided and what is given in the meal Hey, it is important to know the reality of how popular the market is, etc. It is also important to know the reports of at least 8 to 10 tourists who have traveled with this tour operator. </li>
             <li>How to pay to the tour operator - At the time of booking, pay only the price of flight or train ticket + Rs 2000 to 2500 per person and pay the remaining amount 8-10 days in advance.</li>
             <li>Many tour operators do not even go on tour themselves, so it is also important to know whether the tour operator himself accompanies the tour or sends Ram bhrosse with inexperienced men.</li>
             <li>The tour operators who talk a lot and say that we only do this sightseeing, no one else gets the tour done - no one gives food like us - no hotel like ours gives it - only the total at the time of booking to the tour operator Give 10% of the tour price and talk about paying the remaining amount bit by bit during the tour, which will also reveal its truth and reality.</li>
